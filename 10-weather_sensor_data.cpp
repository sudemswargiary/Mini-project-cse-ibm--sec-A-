/*Problem : Count Positive and Negative Numbers (Weather Sensor Data)    //QUESTION 10
🧩 Problem Story:
A weather station records temperature readings during the day.
Positive readings mean above 0°C, negative readings mean below 0°C, and zero means exactly 0°C.
Your job is to analyze the data and find how many readings are positive, negative, and zero.
Input Format:
The first line contains an integer n — the number of readings.
The second line contains n space-separated integers representing the readings.
🖥️ Output Format:
Print three lines as shown:
Positive = x
Negative = y
Zero = z
Example 1:
Input
6
3 -2 0 7 -5 8
Output
Positive = 3
Negative = 2
Zero = 1 */
